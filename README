Prog 1 : Ants VS Bees 
Aurèle Barrière and Rémy Sun

In this directory you will find our project. 

The Game :
You are controlling an ant colony under the attack of many bees.
You will have to put ants on the tunnels so they can try to push the attacker away. 
You will have some food (initially 10) and every ant has a cost.
The game is turned-based (one turn per second).

The bees :
They will come randomly in the tunnels. They simply go to the left of the screen or attack any ant that blocks their way.
They have an armor of 2

The ants :
Harvester ant => each turn, produces 1 food. 
cost 2 / armor 1

Thrower ant => each turn, fires a little rock that damage the bees.
cost 6 / armor 1

Short Thrower ant => fires a rock if it is close enough
cost 3 / armor 1

Long Thrower ant => fires arock if is far enough
cost 3 / armor 1

Fire ant => when it dies, it explodes with all the bees in the same place
cost 6 / armor 3

Scuba ant => same as the Thrower ant, but can go in flooded tunnels
cost 8 / armor 1

Wall ant => never attack bees, but is resistant
cost 4 / armor 4

Ninja ant => can never be damaged by bees, attack one of the bees in its place each turn
cost 10 / armor 1(never reduced)

Hungry ant => can eat a whole bee (randomly regenerating armor when it happens), then has to wait 3 turns for digestion
cost 5 / armor 3

Bodyguard => can be put in the same place as another ant to improve its armor
cost 3 / armor 2

Queen => there can be only one queen. All ants put after the queen will have its damage doubled.
cost 300 /  armor 2

Losing :
When a bee goes through the last tunnel or when the queen die, the ant colony is lost. Food drops down to 0 (the ants are buzy fleeing and cannot be placed anymore), the ninjas disappear and the other ants already on the tunnels can try to survive.

Winning :
There is no way to win this game, bees will always spawn. However, a great battle is more honorable. Each time you kill a bee, your score increases. It is possible to kill more than 3000 bees. Can you do more?

How to play :
Select a cell and then a tunnel to add an ant. 
You can also select a cell by pressing the a key (use the second and third rows of an azerty keyboard).
On the top-right corner, you will see your food and your score.
You can press 'n' to skip the animation and directly go to the next turn.
You can press 'a' to save your game, then 'z' to load it. There might still be some bugs with this feature.
